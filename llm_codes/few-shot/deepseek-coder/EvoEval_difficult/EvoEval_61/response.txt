To optimize the `correct_bracketing_advanced` function for energy efficiency, we can leverage a stack data structure to ensure that we only traverse the string once, which minimizes the number of operations and thus reduces energy consumption. Here's an optimized version of the function:

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    brackets is a string comprising "(", ")", "{", "}", "[", "]".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type and is correctly nested. 
    The bracket types must not intersect with one another.
    """
    # Dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket in matching_bracket.values():
            # If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket in matching_bracket.keys():
            # If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack
            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[bracket]:
                stack.pop()  # Pop the matching opening bracket from the stack
            else:
                return False  # Mismatch or stack is empty (unmatched closing bracket)
        else:
            return False  # Invalid character in the string
    
    # If the stack is empty, all brackets were matched correctly
    return len(stack) == 0

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("("))        # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("()"))       # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("(()())"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced(")(()"))     # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}]"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}"))    # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[()]}"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[(])}"))   # False
```

### Explanation:
1. **Dictionary for Matching Brackets**: We use a dictionary `matching_bracket` to quickly map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.
2. **Stack for Tracking Opening Brackets**: We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets as we encounter them.
3. **Single Pass Through the String**: We iterate through the string once, performing constant-time operations for each character.
4. **Efficient Matching**: When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the top of the stack in constant time. If it does, we pop the stack; if it doesn't, we return `False`.
5. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were matched correctly.

This approach ensures that we only perform a linear number of operations relative to the length of the string, making it both time and energy efficient.
