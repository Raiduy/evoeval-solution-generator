```python
def add_elements(list1: list, list2: list, index: int):
    try:
        result = list1[index] + list2[index]
        return result, False
    except IndexError:
        return None, True
```

This function takes in two lists and an index as input. It tries to add the elements at the given index in both lists and returns the result along with a boolean indicating whether an exception occurred. If the index is out of range for one of the lists, an IndexError is caught and the function returns None along with a boolean indicating that an exception occurred.
