def customFibFib(n: int, startSequence: list, p: int):
    if n < 3:
        return startSequence[n]
    else:
        a, b, c = startSequence
        for i in range(3, n+1):
            a, b, c = b, c, a+b+c
            if c > p:
                return 'Limit Exceeded'
        return c
```

Explanation:

The function first checks if `n` is less than 3. If it is, it returns the corresponding element from the `startSequence` list. If `n` is greater than or equal to 3, it initializes `a`, `b`, and `c` to the first three elements of the `startSequence` list. It then enters a loop that runs from 3 to `n` (inclusive). In each iteration of the loop, it updates `a`, `b`, and `c` to be the previous values of `b`, `c`, and `a+b+c`, respectively. If `c` exceeds `p`, it immediately returns 'Limit Exceeded'. If the loop completes without encountering a limit exceeded condition, it returns the final value of `c`.
