Explanation:

We initialize four variables: smallest, largest, second_smallest, and second_largest. We iterate through the list and update these variables accordingly.

If the current number is smaller than the smallest number we've seen so far, we update the second_smallest variable to be the smallest number we've seen so far, and update the smallest variable to be the current number.

If the current number is smaller than the second_smallest number we've seen so far and is not equal to the smallest number, we update the second_smallest variable to be the current number.

If the current number is larger than the largest number we've seen so far, we update the second_largest variable to be the largest number we've seen so far, and update the largest variable to be the current number.

If the current number is larger than the second_largest number we've seen so far and is not equal to the largest number, we update the second_largest variable to be the current number.

Finally, we return a tuple of the second_smallest and second_largest variables.
