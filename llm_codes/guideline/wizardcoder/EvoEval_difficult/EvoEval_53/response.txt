Here is the completed function:

```python
def add_elements(list1: list, list2: list, index: int):
    try:
        result = list1[index] + list2[index]
        return (result, False)
    except IndexError:
        return (None, True)
```

This function first tries to add the elements at the provided index from two provided lists. If the index is out of range for one of the lists, an IndexError exception is raised and caught in the except block. In this case, the function returns a tuple where the first element is None (since no valid addition operation could be performed), and the second element is a boolean True (indicating that an exception occurred).
