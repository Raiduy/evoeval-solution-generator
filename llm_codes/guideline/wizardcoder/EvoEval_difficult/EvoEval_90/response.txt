Here is the Python code that meets the requirements:

```python
def next_smallest_and_largest(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return (None, None)
    smallest = second_smallest = float('inf')
    largest = second_largest = float('-inf')
    for num in lst:
        if num < smallest:
            second_smallest = smallest
            smallest = num
        elif smallest < num < second_smallest:
            second_smallest = num
        if second_largest < num:
            second_largest = second_largest
            largest = num
        elif second_largest < num < largest:
            second_largestest = num
    if second_smallest == float('inf'):
        smallest = None
    if second_largest == float('-inf'):
        second_largest = None
    return (second_smallest, second_largest)
```

This function works by iterating over the list and updating the smallest and the second smallest elements, and the second largest and the largest elements as it encounters them. It then returns a tuple of the second smallest and the second largest elements.
