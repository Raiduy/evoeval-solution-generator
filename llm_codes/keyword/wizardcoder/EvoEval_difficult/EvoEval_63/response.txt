Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def customFibFib(n: int, startSequence: list, p: int):
    if n < len(startSequence):
        return startSequence[n]
    sequence = startSequenceSequence + [0] * (n - len(startSequence) + 1)
    for i in range(len(startSequence), n + 1):
        sequence[i] = sum(sequence[i-j] for j in range(1, 4))
        if sequence[i] > p:
            return 'Limit Exceeded'
    return sequence[n]
```

This function first checks if the n-th element is within the initial sequence. If it is, it simply returns that element.

If the n-th element is not within the initial sequence, it then generates the rest of the sequence up to the n-th element. During this generation process, if the sum at any point exceeds the positive integer 'p', the function immediately returns 'Limit Exceeded' without continuing the computation.
