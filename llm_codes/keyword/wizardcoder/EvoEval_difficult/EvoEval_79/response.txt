Here is the Python code for the problem:

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal, padding_length):
    if not isinstance(decimal, int) or not isinstance(padding_length, int) or decimal < 0 or padding_length < 0:
        return "Invalid Input"
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:]
    if len(binary) > padding_length:
        return "Padding length is too small"
    return "db" + "0" * (padding_length - len(binary))) + binary
```

This function first checks if the inputs are valid. If not, it returns an error message.

Then, it converts the decimal number to its binary representation.

After that, it checks if the length of the binary representation is greater than the padding_length. If it is, it returns an error message.

Finally, it returns the binary representation of the decimal number, padded with '0's at the beginning to reach the required padding_length.
