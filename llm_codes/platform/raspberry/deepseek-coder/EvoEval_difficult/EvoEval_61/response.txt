To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a stack data structure. The stack will help us keep track of the opening brackets and ensure that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket. This approach ensures that the brackets are correctly nested and that different types of brackets do not intersect improperly.

Here's the implementation:

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    brackets is a string comprising "(", ")", "{", "}", "[", "]".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type and is correctly nested. 
    The bracket types must not intersect with one another.
    """
    # Dictionary to hold the matching pairs of brackets
    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket in matching_bracket.values():
            # If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket in matching_bracket.keys():
            # If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack
            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[bracket]:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return False
        else:
            # If the character is not a bracket, return False (though the problem guarantees only brackets)
            return False
    
    # If the stack is empty, all brackets were matched correctly
    return len(stack) == 0

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("("))       # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("()"))      # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("(()())"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced(")(()"))    # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}]"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}"))   # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[()]}"))  # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[(])}"))  # False
```

### Explanation:
1. **Matching Bracket Dictionary**: We use a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket.
2. **Stack**: We use a list as a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
3. **Iteration**: We iterate through each character in the input string:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), we push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`), we check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, we pop the stack; otherwise, we return `False`.
4. **Final Check**: After iterating through the string, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were matched correctly; otherwise, there are unmatched opening brackets.

This approach ensures that the code is both efficient and easy to understand, making good use of the Raspberry Pi's hardware capabilities.
