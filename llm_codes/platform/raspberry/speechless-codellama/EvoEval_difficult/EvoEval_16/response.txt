```python
def count_distinct_characters_substrings(string: str, length: int) -> dict:
    if length > len(string):
        return {}
    result = {}
    for i in range(len(string) - length + 1):
        substring = string[i:i+length]
        distinct_chars = set(substring)
        result[substring] = len(distinct_chars)
    return result
```

This code first checks if the length is greater than the string length, and returns an empty dictionary if it is. Then, it initializes an empty dictionary called `result`. It then loops through the string, taking substrings of the specified length and adding them to the `result` dictionary. The distinct characters in each substring are found using the `set()` function, and the count of distinct characters is added to the `result` dictionary as the value for the corresponding key (the substring). Finally, the `result` dictionary is returned.
