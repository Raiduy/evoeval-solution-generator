Here is the completed code for the `weighted_mean_absolute_deviation` function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def weighted_mean_absolute_deviation(numbers: List[Tuple[float, float]]) -> float:
    total_weight = sum(w for _, w in numbers)
    
    if total_weight != 1 or any(w <= 0 for _, w in numbers):
        return "Weights must be positive and sum to 1"
    
    weighted_mean = sum(x * w for x, w in numbers)
    wmad = sum(w * abs(x - weighted_mean) for x, w in numbers) / total_weight
    
    return wmad

# Test the function
print(weighted_mean_absolute_deviation([(1.0, 0.1), (2.0, 0.2), (3.0, 0.3), (4.0, 0.4)])
```

This code calculates the Weighted Mean Absolute Deviation around the weighted mean of the dataset provided in the input list of tuples. It checks if the weights are positive and sum to 1 before performing the calculation.
