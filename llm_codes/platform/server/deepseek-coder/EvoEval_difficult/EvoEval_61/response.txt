To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a stack data structure. The stack will help us keep track of the opening brackets and ensure that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket. Here's the implementation:

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """
    brackets is a string comprising "(", ")", "{", "}", "[", "]".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket of the same type and is correctly nested. 
    The bracket types must not intersect with one another.
    """
    # Dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
    matching_bracket = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}
    
    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket in matching_bracket.values():
            # If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket in matching_bracket.keys():
            # If it's a closing bracket, check if it matches the top of the stack
            if stack and stack[-1] == matching_bracket[bracket]:
                stack.pop()
            else:
                return False
        else:
            # If the character is not a bracket, return False (though the problem statement guarantees only brackets)
            return False
    
    # If the stack is empty, all brackets were matched correctly
    return len(stack) == 0

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("("))        # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("()"))       # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("(()())"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced(")(()"))     # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}]"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("[{()}"))    # False
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[()]}"))   # True
print(correct_bracketing_advanced("{[(])}"))   # False
```

### Explanation:
1. **Matching Brackets Dictionary**: We use a dictionary to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket. This helps in quickly checking if a closing bracket matches the most recent opening bracket.
2. **Stack**: We use a list as a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the top of the stack. If it does, we pop the stack; otherwise, the brackets are not correctly nested.
3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means all brackets were matched correctly. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets.

This approach ensures that the function runs in linear time, \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string, making it efficient for large inputs.
