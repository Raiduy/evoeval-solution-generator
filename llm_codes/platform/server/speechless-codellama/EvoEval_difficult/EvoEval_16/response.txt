```python
def count_distinct_characters_substrings(string: str, length: int) -> dict:
    if length > len(string):
        return {}
    result = {}
    for i in range(len(string) - length + 1):
        substring = string[i:i+length]
        distinct_chars = set(substring)
        result[substring] = len(distinct_chars)
    return result
```

This code first checks if the length is greater than the string length, and returns an empty dictionary if it is. Then, it initializes an empty dictionary to store the results. It loops through the string, taking substrings of the specified length and adding them to the dictionary along with their count of distinct characters. Finally, it returns the dictionary of results.
