```python
def add_elements(list1: list, list2: list, index: int):
    try:
        result = list1[index] + list2[index]
        return (result, False)
    except IndexError:
        return (None, True)
```

This code defines the `add_elements` function that takes three arguments: `list1`, `list2`, and `index`. It then tries to add the elements at the specified index from both lists and returns the result along with a boolean indicating whether an exception occurred. If the index is out of range for one of the lists, it catches the `IndexError` exception and returns `None` along with a boolean indicating that an exception occurred.
