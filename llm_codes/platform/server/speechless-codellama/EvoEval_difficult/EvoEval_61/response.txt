Here's the optimized code for the `correct_bracketing_advanced` function:

```python
def correct_bracketing_advanced(brackets: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket in "([{":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket in ")]}":
            if not stack:
                return False
            if bracket == ")" and stack.pop() != "(":
                return False
            if bracket == "]" and stack.pop() != "[":
                return False
            if bracket == "}" and stack.pop() != "{":
                return False
    return not stack
```

This implementation uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and their corresponding closing brackets. It iterates through the input string and pushes opening brackets onto the stack, and pops closing brackets off the stack to check if they match the last opening bracket. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, then all brackets have been correctly nested and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This implementation has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, and a space complexity of O(n), where n is the number of opening brackets in the input string. It makes efficient use of the available hardware by minimizing the number of operations and memory usage.
