```python
def advancedDigitSum(s, t):
    sum_s = 0
    sum_t = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            sum_s += ord(char)
    for char in t:
        if char.islower():
            sum_t += ord(char)
    return (sum_s, sum_t)
```

Explanation:

The function `advancedDigitSum` takes two strings `s` and `t` as input. It initializes two variables `sum_s` and `sum_t` to 0.

It then iterates over each character in the string `s`. If the character is an uppercase letter, it adds the ASCII code of the character to `sum_s` using the `ord` function.

Similarly, it iterates over each character in the string `t`. If the character is a lowercase letter, it adds the ASCII code of the character to `sum_t` using the `ord` function.

Finally, it returns a tuple containing the sums of `sum_s` and `sum_t`.
