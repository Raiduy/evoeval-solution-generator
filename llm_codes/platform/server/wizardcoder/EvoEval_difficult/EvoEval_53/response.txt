Here is the Python code that fulfills your requirements:

```python
def add_elements(list1: list, list2: list, index: int):
    try:
        result = list1[index] + list2[index]
        return (result, False)
    except IndexError:
        return (None, True)
```

This function takes two lists and an index as input. It tries to add the elements at the provided index from both lists. If the index is out of range for one of the lists, an IndexError exception is raised. This exception is then caught and handled by returning a tuple where the first element is None (since no valid addition operation could be performed), and the second element is a boolean True (indicating that an exception occurred).
